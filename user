Hi Jayant,

After getting training in performance testing tool like Jmeter, loadRunner. I’m come up with some idea which we can implement across performance testing project.

As we know loadrunner is paid tool So we have some good feature like LoadRunner Analysis and Monitoring. 


Problem statement 

We have to run Jmeter in non GUI mode to get efficient results. But at that time we can’t analysis performance graph(like -) in real time we have wait for execution to complete and then go for analysis.
